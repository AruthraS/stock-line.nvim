## UI:

Everything is working fine, but UI is still under progress. Iâ€™ll have it ready by tomorrow ðŸ˜‰ ðŸ˜‰!

## Some Serious Stuff

- **Provide proper opts like the following:**

  ```lua
  {
      ticker = "SAMPLE",
      exchange = "SAMPLE",
      bgColor = "SAMPLE", --optional default: #fc4103
      fontColor = "SAMPLE" --optional default: #000000
  }
  ```

- ### Python3 is required so please install it
